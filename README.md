# Mono Celeste Classic
A "port" of Celeste (Classic/PICO-8) to MonoGame for funsies.

A lot of this is just putting the pieces together from the [Celeste repo](https://github.com/NoelFB/Celeste/tree/master/Source/PICO-8) and bits of the [Monocle Engine](https://github.com/JamesMcMahon/monocle-engine) (hence MTexture and MInput).

Not sure if I have a real end goal for this at the moment. Might add some neato features into it later, like save states or something.

Enjoy!
